# Analysed Like Chess Studio

Single-user local web app: upload a movie scene clip, draft chess-style move annotations with cloud AI, edit them over live playback, render an MP4 with freeze-frames burned in. `PLAN.md` is the full build plan; read the section for the current phase before starting work.

## Commands

- `pnpm dev`: web (Vite, http://localhost:5173) and server (Hono, http://127.0.0.1:8787) together. Vite proxies `/api` to the server.
- `pnpm check`: lint, typecheck and tests. Run before every commit.
- `pnpm test` / `pnpm lint` / `pnpm typecheck`: individually.
- `scripts/make-sample-clip.sh`: regenerates `fixtures/sample/source.mp4` (needs system ffmpeg).
- `pnpm seed:sample`: creates a project from the fixture (3 moments). `pnpm seed:moments <projectId> <file>` replaces a project's moments, e.g. `fixtures/demo/doakes-moments.json` for the Dexter demo clip.
- `scripts/browser/`: headless-Chrome checks (`phase2-checks.mjs`, `phase3-checks.mjs`) over the DevTools protocol (no dependencies) against a running `pnpm dev`. The dev build exposes the Player as `window.__alsPlayer`.

## Layout

- `apps/web`: editor UI (Vite, React, Tailwind).
- `apps/server`: Hono API, jobs, ffmpeg, AI adapters, render. Runs TypeScript directly on Node (type stripping), so use only erasable syntax and `.ts` import extensions.
- `packages/schema`: Zod schemas and the types derived from them; the only source of types.
- `packages/composition`: Remotion `<Episode>`, `<MoveCard>`, `timeMap()`. Lint enforces purity.
- `packages/theme`: classification tokens, badges, theme presets.
- `fixtures/`: test data, including the sample project and recorded provider responses.
- `projects/`: runtime project folders, gitignored. `PROJECTS_DIR` overrides the location.
- `media/`: local demo footage (copyrighted), gitignored. Never commit clips.

## Conventions

- All times are source-clip seconds; frames are derived, never stored.
- Holds follow the card text (`autoHoldSec`) unless `holdLocked`. Spoken moves freeze just after the last word, in that word's shot (`freezeAfterSpeech`); the editor's snapping uses the same helpers.
- Editor state is a Zustand store (`apps/web/src/editor/store.ts`) with undo, coalesced typing, gestures for drags, and versioned autosave (409 means reload, never overwrite). Pure edit operations live in `editor/doc.ts`.
- The edit layer draws the same `<MoveCard>` over the Player through its `editing` slots; the render path never passes them.
- Hard invariants (moment spacing, ordering, references) live in `ProjectSchema`. Soft rules (text caps, `bestMove` on best/brilliant) are `momentWarnings()`, so the editor warns without blocking saves.
- The output is the source with a hold at each moment. `buildTimeline()` in `packages/composition` is the only mapping between source and output frames; the Player, timeline UI and renderer all use it.
- `<Episode>` renders one `<Sequence>` per play-then-hold segment so the same `@remotion/media` `<Video>` plays into its `<Freeze>`; premounting loads the next segment. Verified frame-exact in the Player (Phase 2 spike), so the extracted-still fallback is not needed.
- Ingest stages are cached by content hash in each project's `ingest.json`. Bump a step's `STEP_VERSION` in `apps/server/src/ingest/ingest.ts` when its command changes.
- Cut detection uses ffmpeg `scdet` plus peak picking (`apps/server/src/media/cuts.ts`), tuned on dark film footage where real cuts score only 5-10. Check changes against a contact sheet of real footage, not just the synthetic fixture.
- Dependencies are pinned to exact versions (`save-exact` in `.npmrc`). TypeScript stays below 6.1 until typescript-eslint supports newer versions.

## Working rules

1. Build one phase at a time. Do not start a phase until the previous phase's checks pass, and stop to report at the end of each phase.
2. Before writing any call to Remotion, the Claude API, Gemini or the speech-to-text vendor, read that SDK's current docs. Never write API calls from memory. Pin exact dependency versions.
3. `packages/schema` is the only source of types. Never hand-write a type that duplicates a Zod schema.
4. `packages/composition` stays pure: no imports from `apps/`, no network, no clocks, no editor state.
5. Tests never call cloud APIs. Record one real response per provider into `fixtures/` and replay it.
6. API keys live only in the server's `.env`, which is gitignored. Nothing secret reaches the browser.
7. Ask before adding a dependency that is not in the Stack table.
8. Where the creator's format is unknown (exact card look, text length, hold timing), leave a `TODO(open-decision)` comment rather than guessing.
9. Commit after each working step with a message that says what now works.
